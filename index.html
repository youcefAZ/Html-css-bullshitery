            <h1>My favourite things to do</h1>

            <p>In algeria its pretty hard to find a hobby,<br> throughout many experiences i have found what suits me best,
            the following are my hobbies : </p>

            <ul>

                <li><strong>Gaming :</strong> gaming was a big part of my life as a child, I used to play games since i was 4 yo,
                my all time favourite games are : 
                <br><br>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Dota 2 :</strong> The hardest <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ar%C3%A8ne_de_bataille_en_ligne_multijoueur">moba</a> game, it is renown for its complexity and its hard learning curve,
                    although its very rewarding after it.</li>
                    <li><strong>Half life 2 : </strong> Its not for nothing that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2W0N3uKXmo">HL3</a> meme is still alive even after 15 years since  valve created the last HL game,
                    It had everything right, a good story, a fun gameplay, futuristic physics engine, good graphics etc..</li>
                    <li><strong>Witcher 3 :</strong> Perhaps the best game this generation had to offer, this <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeu_vid%C3%A9o_de_r%C3%B4le">rpg</a> game was so big even its dlc size surpassed
                    some of its competitor main game, the story was deep and rewarding, every choice had consequences, the side quests are as good as the main ones,
                    no character was good or bad, everyone is grey and its up to you to decide wich side you should be.</li>
                </ul></li>

                <br> <hr> <br>
                <li><strong>Watching movies : </strong> As every geek in this world, i watch movies that i find intresting, mostly action movies,
                my favourite movies : 
                <br><br>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Harry potter : </strong>As a kid i was a fan of harry potter's saga, both the movies and the books,
                    The story grew with me, the 1st ones were story for kids, then as the story continued, it covered harry's problems as an ado then as an adult,
                    A true masterpiece, There might me magic in their world, but the story and characters were even more magical.</li>

                    <li><strong>Lord of the rings : </strong>Well we can thank R.R Tolkien for the masterpiece he created, The world he made was just astroundishing,
                    He created many races, each has their own ups and downs, he created languages, continents, the lore is just too vast and exciting.</li>
                
                </ul></li>
                <br> <hr> <br>
                <li><strong>Reading books : </strong> Books gives a different feeling comparing to movies,
                You read at your own pace so it always suits you, and it allows for more creativity and a better description of what's happening,
                My favourite books : 
                <br><br>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Harry potter : </strong> Already mentioned above, the plus is that the books just have more content and more
                     character building compared to the movies, its just better.</li>

                    <li><strong>Metro : </strong> I discovered the metro series from its games, but the books are more dark and realistic, 
                    its original language is russian so the translation is a bit off in english but its still a good experience nonethless.</li>
                </ul></li>
            </ul>

            <br><br>

            <p>And of course, programming is both a hobby and the way ill earn money, I also watch anime but fuck that <em>weeb</em> shit.</p>
